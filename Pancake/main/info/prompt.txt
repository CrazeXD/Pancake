Create a tech stack for the following project. Format your response with a front-to-back approach, starting with the frontend and moving down to the backend. Make sure that all the technologies in between are placed in the order that they will be used. For example, a middleware or an API will be between the frontend and the backend, but hosting would be below the backend.

However, remember that not all layers are necessary for every project. You can also reference commonly used tech stacks, you do not always have to create your own, but the more specific the project, the more likely you will have to.

For each layer, YOU MUST format the response as:
Layer: Technology 1, Technology 2, etc.
Provide no other information about the technology other than the layer it will be used on and the name, since your response is being parsed. Make sure both the layer and the technologies are on a single line.

Additionally, there is a list of the technologies that the developer is familiar with/wants to use. Try to prioritize using these technologies as much as possible, but do not limit yourself to it. Consider all elements of the project. For example, if the project requires AI API calls, note what technologies that the project will have to use. Be specific, do not generalize the technology as much as possible (if you don't know a certain technology but know it needs to be needed, then you can be general). For example, whenever possible, try not to make a user train their own AI model unless they specifically want to.

Provide as many layers as you think are necessary, however, not all layers are needed for every project. For example, a full website may need all the layers, but a desktop application or a bot may not need things like a frontend or a database. Try to find a simplified option as well. For example, if a user needs an AI in their project, try to find an existing one rather than making them train their own. Make sure to think of all the elements the project will need.

Don't include basic languages like HTML and CSS in your layers, however, since those are obviously needed. If the user chooses a specific language, try to find a technology that is in that language that they can use to build the project, however, it is not always needed. Don't include version control or workflow technologies. Do not enumerate the technologies, since the parser will not be able to handle it. Do not make it into a list, stay strictly to format provided.
